# HOLD-1, desk sender log, pre-run 6

> Counts only. The desk's sender log. It is not a chain count. Mini counts the chain.

Payment offer 1,013 tx/s at 150 sompi/gram, from 2 payment senders, one per kept public node. Families offer 1.2 hop/s, 16 families live, one family-sender process and one builder.

Payment pile: 6,000 coins on the payment key at the preflight, dealt evenly over the 2 senders before the first payment (last deal, start: 3,000 / 3,000 coins, even). A coin is re-used about once a second, so one sender's ceiling is about its pool per second.

## Hop rate per cohort, as built

Floor (families 1–13): 100 sompi/gram per hop. Double (families 14–16): 200 sompi/gram per hop. The rate rides on each hop line to the one builder.

## Funding coins, as read from the desk node

The funding coins were not one size. Sizes seen, whole tKAS (coins): 30 (1,531), 29 (1,270), 31 (1,255), 32 (997), 33 (753), 34 (527), 28 (382), 35 (374), 36 (237), 37 (99), 38 (82), 27 (75), and 61 more sizes. The fee is not called the whole cause.

A family stall is a coordinator mark: no hop of that family landed for a while. The family was still attempting. It is logged, and it does not make the minute dirty.

Within 10 percent means 54,702 to 66,858 submit-OK in the minute.

## Public nodes (local numbers)

Kept: 1, 5. The family sender is on node 1. Both cohorts share that node.

Kept nodes are unique kaspads: each answered with its own node id at the preflight. 3 candidate endpoints passed the check and were 2 kaspads (node 4 is node 1; the second hostname was not used). One payment sender per kaspad.

## Hop submit to landing, per cohort

| Cohort | Landed of OK | Median ms | Slow tail (p95) ms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| floor | 1528 of 1528 | 1123 | 2580 |
| double | 419 of 419 | 947 | 2214 |

Landing is the accepting block header time the desk's coordinator read. Waiting is submitted-OK not yet landed at the minute's end.
