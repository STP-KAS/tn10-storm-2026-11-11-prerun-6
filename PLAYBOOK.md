> **This is the playbook for pre-run 6.** It is not Wednesday. It is not Tuesday. It is not pre-run 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. It does not start a machine and it does not arm one. A read of this page is not a paste.

# Playbook

This page states who does what, and the gates before each machine may start, so Mini, the desk (Build), and the bot do not guess. The plan is [plan/PLAN.md](plan/PLAN.md), the locks are [locks/LOCKED.md](locks/LOCKED.md), and the pastes are the three go files. This page does not override them.

Pre-run 1 is [tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun](https://github.com/STP-KAS/tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun). Pre-run 2 is [tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun-2](https://github.com/STP-KAS/tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun-2). Pre-run 3 is [tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun-3](https://github.com/STP-KAS/tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun-3). Pre-run 4 is [tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun-4](https://github.com/STP-KAS/tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun-4). Those four failed and are closed. Pre-run 5 is [tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun-5](https://github.com/STP-KAS/tn10-storm-2026-11-11-prerun-5). It finished through RETURN and is closed. Their files are history. None of them is a live gate here.

## Oversight

TN10 ops oversees this rehearsal end to end: Mini, the desk (Build), and the bot. TN10 only. Never mainnet. Keep disk safe. Do not edit the Tuesday repo, the Wednesday repo, or pre-run 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, or 5's go files. Do not write `REVIEW_CLOSED`.

For pre-run 6 the operator does not paste. On 2026-11-11 he said to start everything, with no pastes, and to execute until successful. That instruction is the arm. The agents on the desk, Mini, and the bot start their own runners once the gates are facts. A sentence in chat still does not write `PRE-RUN-OPEN`: the desk runner writes it after its gates. Oversight does not arm a machine by itself.

What oversight checks:

- Nodes: the existing TN10 process is the one that is up on Mini and on the desk, data is not wiped, each node is synced with DAA moving before we count or send. The desk node is started with PowerShell 7, never Windows PowerShell 5.1. `KaspaPublicNode` is not started. The desk devnet is left alone.
- Hashes: `hashes/SIXTEEN.md` with sixteen family rows and an On origin line, before the first family submit. Not the old 8- or 32-family publisher. No On origin line, no send. The covenant id stays off the repo.
- Senders: one family-sender on the desk, payments only as the plan allows, the bot only in the HOLD-4 minute on a leftover synced public node, or a legal `NO SEND`. No second runner. No waiter left over from a dead run.
- Files: desk, Mini, and bot each write only their own folder in this repo. HOLD-4 is the pinned minute after desk HOLD-3 is on origin.
- Disk and abort: do not start if the lane would fall under 2,500 coins or 18,000 usable tKAS. Do not print balances or secrets.

## Start gates

There is no clock. Each gate is a fact read from a node or from origin, in this order.

1. **Mini node synced.** Existing TN10 kaspad, existing data, no wipe. `isSynced` true, DAA moving. Mini notifies Build and TN10 ops.
2. **Desk node synced.** Existing private TN10 kaspad, existing data, loopback only, started with `pwsh`. No wipe. Synced, DAA moving.
3. **No other runner.** No Tuesday, Wednesday, pre-run 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 runner or waiter on any machine. Lane above the abort line.
4. **Hashes.** The desk pushes `hashes/SIXTEEN.md` with [tools/sixteen](tools/sixteen/README.md): sixteen rows and an On origin line. It is not an arm and not a send, and it does not wait for the paste.
5. **Arm.** The operator's instruction to start everything. No paste. The agents start the runners.
6. **Open.** The desk pushes `logs/PRE-RUN-OPEN.md` here. Mini then pushes `logs/MINI-ARMED.md` here.
7. **Families, then senders.** The genesis transactions come from the bundle that wrote `hashes/SIXTEEN.md`. Nothing rebuilds it. Families start. Then 1,013, 2,027, 3,040, the HOLD-4 minute, and RETURN.

## Who does what

| Who | Role | When to start | What not to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Desk (Build)** | Sends the sixteen families and the payment offers. Does not count the chain. Publishes `hashes/SIXTEEN.md` first, then `logs/PRE-RUN-OPEN.md`, then `counts/desk/` as each step closes. | After gates 1–4. First sentence: `DESK. I send on pre-run 6. I do not count. This is not Wednesday.` No family submit before `hashes/SIXTEEN.md` has an On origin line and `MINI-ARMED` is on origin. | Do not start from a chat sentence. Do not count. Do not stop or wipe the desk TN10 node. Do not use Windows PowerShell 5.1 or start `KaspaPublicNode`. Do not touch the desk devnet. Do not use the 8- or 32-family publisher. Do not drop a HOLD-3 node to free one for the bot. Do not start a second runner. |
| **Mini** | The only chain counter. Does not send, mine, or hold a key. Publishes `logs/MINI-ARMED.md` after `PRE-RUN-OPEN` is on origin here, then `counts/mini/` when the matching desk file is on origin. | Node synced and Build notified first. Arms only after the operator pastes [GO-MINI.md](GO-MINI.md) and this repo's `PRE-RUN-OPEN` is on origin. First sentence: `MINI. I count pre-run 6. I do not send. This is not Wednesday.` | Do not send. Do not wipe chain data. Do not resume pre-run 1 or start its runner tasks or Tuesday's. Do not count before the gate file. |
| **Bot (TN10 ops)** | Sends payments in the HOLD-4 minute only, on one leftover synced public node outside the desk HOLD-3 set, or publishes a legal `NO SEND`. Publishes `counts/bot/HOLD-4.md`. Does not count the chain. No local node. | After the operator pastes [GO-BOT.md](GO-BOT.md). Sends only after `PRE-RUN-OPEN`, `hashes/SIXTEEN.md`, and desk `counts/desk/HOLD-3.md` are on origin here, in the pinned HOLD-4 minute. First sentence: `GROKBOT. I send payments on the pre-run 6 HOLD-4 only. I do not count. This is not Wednesday.` Stops on this repo's `logs/BOT-HALT.md` or `logs/FAILED.md`. | Do not send on HOLD-1, HOLD-2, HOLD-3, or RETURN. Do not start a second waiter. Do not treat chat or a pre-run 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 file as the start. |

## Status when this repo was opened

Not a gate. A status line, so nobody guesses.

- Mini: existing TN10 kaspad 2.1.0 up since 2026-11-11T07:31:03Z, no wipe, synced, DAA moving. Pre-run 5's Mini counter was stopped before this repo opened.
- Desk: existing private TN10 kaspad 2.1.0 up since 2026-11-11T07:44:58Z with `pwsh`, no wipe, synced, DAA moving. It is not stopped for this pre-run.
- Box: no local TN10 node. No bot waiter running.
- Hashes: `hashes/SIXTEEN.md` is absent. Pre-run 5's genesis coins are spent. Keys that had no genesis coin were given one fresh coin each from the family lane (key 0).
- Payment pile: topped up from the family lane to 6,000 coins on the payment key (pre-run 5 had 2,000), one lane coin per transaction at 150 sompi/gram. The lane stays above the abort line with margin. With two kaspads that is about 3,000 coins per sender: HOLD-3's share is 1,520 a second per sender, HOLD-4's 2,027.
- Runner: passed a no-undef lint and an offline rehearsal on the desk (a local origin, a fake family sender, a local stand-in for the payment key's network that rejects a coin already spent in the mempool, 6,000 fake payment coins, real signing, no live send). Rehearsal readings:
  - Preflight: five candidate hostnames, two silent, node 4 the same kaspad as node 1. Kept nodes 1 and 5, two payment senders. Pile 6,000, dealt 3,000 / 3,000 (`POOL_SPLIT fair=1`), and each sender loaded 3,000 from its lane file (`POOL_LOADED`).
  - HOLD-1 with its one repair inside HOLD-1: node 5 was marked unsynced in the stand-in until the repair, so six minutes were dirty (60,809–60,858 submit-OK each). The repair asked both senders to hand off: both wrote their pools (3,000 each, nothing killed), the pools were checked and dealt again (3,000 / 3,000), both started, both loaded 3,000, and `REPAIR_RESTART running=2/2 killed=0 pool=3000/3000 fair=1`. The next three minutes were clean at 60,876, 60,804, and 60,842, and HOLD-1 closed `MET` with its count file rendered.
  - Pacing: a minute at 1,013 a second is now about 60,800–60,880 submit-OK, not 59 loops of the share (59,767 in pre-run 5).
- Known risks, not fixed mid-run:
  - The signed one-in one-out inclusion line on TN10 is about 3,040–3,080 a second. HOLD-3 sits on it, and HOLD-4 at 4,053 is above it for this payment shape. Submit-OK can run ahead of inclusion; Mini's files carry what the chain accepted.
  - One desk process signs about 3,000 payments a second in a tight loop. HOLD-4's 2,027 per sender is inside that, with less headroom than HOLD-3.
  - Unique kaspads: the last check found two kaspads among the desk's candidates and the bot's extra endpoints. The bot is expected to write `NO SEND` and `no-free-node` unless another kaspad is free and synced in its pass.
- Arm: the operator's instruction to start everything, and on 2026-11-11 to keep going and spend what the run needs. Nothing has sent from this repo.

## When something breaks

Append a worked fix to [locks/LOCKED.md](locks/LOCKED.md) in the form that page shows, and a repair line to `logs/FIXES.md`. If the run dies before RETURN, write `logs/FAILED.md`, stop every runner and waiter, and do not resume. The next attempt is a new repo that starts from this repo's lock file. Do not rewrite the go files in this repo to match the result.
